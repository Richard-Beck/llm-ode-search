Task: From the sampled observations (possibly noisy, partially observed) and any input schedules, produce a SINGLE JSON object that fully specifies an rxode2-solvable model spec for simulation and parameter initialization. Your output will be used as the starting point for a numerical optimization. Your output MUST satisfy the schema and constraints below. Do not include explanations.

DATA (read-only)
-----------
Packet (array of condition objects):
{{packet_json}}

Optional prior/model menu (free text hints; you may ignore if unhelpful):
{{model_hints}}

{{schema}}

DERIVATION HINTS (non-binding)
-----------
- Use variable_summaries, pairwise lags, and input schedules from the packet to choose a plausible structure and initial guesses.
- Keep complexity low–moderate (1–4 states, 4–10 parameters). Favor identifiable forms.

OUTPUT
-----------
Return ONLY the JSON object. No prose.
