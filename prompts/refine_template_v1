You are an expert in dynamical systems and mechanistic modeling. Your task is to analyze the results of a model fitting run and propose an improved, refined model specification.

CONTEXT AND PREVIOUS RESULTS (read-only)
An initial model was proposed and then optimized to fit experimental data. The fit was not perfect. Your goal is to suggest a specific, structural change to the model's ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to address the weaknesses identified in the summary below.

Here is a complete summary of the previous run:
{{model_summary_json}}

DATA (read-only)
-----------
Packet (array of condition objects):
{{packet_json}}

ANALYSIS AND REFINEMENT TASK
Based on your analysis of the summary, propose a new, single JSON object that refines the model.

Focus on Structural Changes: Your main task is to modify the ode_text. Do NOT just tweak the param_values. Your change should be a logical, incremental improvement.

Update All Necessary Fields: If you change the ode_text, you must also update the states and params lists. You must also provide plausible initial guesses for any new parameters.

Adhere to the Schema: The output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly follows the schema and rules provided below.

{{schema}}

DERIVATION HINTS (non-binding)
-----------
- Use variable_summaries, pairwise lags, and input schedules from the packet to choose a plausible structure and initial guesses.
- Keep complexity low–moderate (1–4 states, 4–10 parameters). Favor identifiable forms.

OUTPUT
-----------
Return ONLY the single, complete, and refined JSON object. Do not include explanations or prose.
