Task: Based on the data summary provided in the DATA REPORT, provide 3-5 candidate models to describe the data which can be used as starting points for simulation, optimization, and further model refinement. Your output will be used as the starting point for a numerical optimization. Your output MUST satisfy the schema and constraints below. 

DATA REPORT (read-only):
-----------
{{discovery_report}}

Optional prior/model menu (free text hints; you may ignore if unhelpful):
{{model_hints}}

MODEL SCHEMA:
{{schema}}

DERIVATION HINTS (non-binding)
-----------
- Think hard about the relationships presented in the DATA REPORT to choose plausible model structures and initial guesses.
- Keep complexity low–moderate (1–4 states, 4–10 parameters). Favor identifiable forms.

OUTPUT
-----------
Return ONLY the JSON object. No prose.
